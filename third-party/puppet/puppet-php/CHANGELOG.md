### Breaking Changes
 * Deep merge `php::extensions` the same way as `php::settings`. This technically is a
   breaking change but should not affect many people.
 * PHP 5.6 is the default version on all systems now (except Ubuntu 16.04, where 7.0 is the default).
 * There's a php::globals class now, where global paramters (like the PHP version) are set. (#132)
 * Removal of php::repo::ubuntu::ppa (#218)

## 3.4.2
 * Fix a bug that changed the default of `php::manage_repos` to `false` on
   Debian-based operating systems except wheezy. It should be turned on by
   default. (#116)
 * Fix a bug that prevented reloading php-fpm on Ubuntu in some cases.
   (#117, #107)

## 3.4.1
 * Fix reloading php-fpm on Ubuntu trusty & utopic (#107)

## 3.4.0
 * New parameter `ppa` for class `php::repo::ubuntu` to specify the ppa
   name to use. We default to `ondrej/php5-oldstable` for precise and
   `ondrej/php5` otherwise.
 * New parameter `include` for `php::fpm::pool` resources to specify
   custom configuration files.

## 3.3.1
 * Make `systemd_interval` parameter for class `php::fpm::config` optional

## 3.3.0
 * `php::extension` resources:
   * New boolean parameter `settings_prefix` to automatically prefix all
     settings keys with the extensions names. Defaults to false to ensurre
     the current behaviour.
   * New string parameter `so_name` to set the DSO name of an extension if
     it doesn't match the package name.
   * New string parameter `php_api_version` to set a custom api version. If
     not `undef`, the `so_name` is prefixed with the full module path in the
     ini file. Defaults to `undef`.
 * The default of the parameter `listen_allowed_clients` of `php::fpm::pool`
   resources is now `undef` instead of `'127.0.0.1'`. This way it is more
   intuitive to change the default tcp listening socket at `127.0.0.1:9000`
   to a unix socket by only setting the `listen` parameter instead of
   additionally needing to unset `listen_allowed_clients`. This has no
   security implications.
 * New parameters for the `php::fpm::config` class:
   * `error_log`
   * `syslog_facility`
   * `syslog_ident`
   * `systemd_interval`
 * A bug that prevented merging the global `php::settings` parameter into
   SAPI configs for `php::cli` and `php::fpm` was fixed.
 * The dotdeb repos are now only installed for Debian wheezy as Debian jessie
   has a sufficiently recent PHP version.

## 3.2.2
 * Fix a typo in hiera keys `php::settings` & `php::fpm::settings` (#83)

## 3.2.1
 * Fixed default `yum_repo` key in `php::repo::redhat`
 * On Ubuntu precise we now use the ondrej/php5-oldstable ppa. This can be
   manually enabled with by setting `$php::repo::ubuntu::oldstable` to
   `true`.
 * `$php::ensure` now defaults to `present` instead of `latest`. Though,
   strictly speaking, this represents a functional change, we consider this
   to be a bugfix because automatic updates should be enabled explicitely.
 * `$php::ensure` is not anymore passed to `php::extension` resources as
   default ensure parameter because this doesn't make sense.

## 3.2.0
 * Support for FreeBSD added by Frank Wall
 * RedHat now uses remi-php56 yum repo by default
 * The resource `php::fpm::pool` is now public, you can use it in your
   manifests without using `$php::fpm::pools`
 * We now have autogenerated documentation using `puppetlabs/strings`

## 3.1.0
 * New parameter `pool_purge` for `php::extension` to remove files not
   managed by puppet from the pool directory.
 * The `pecl_source` parameter for `php::extension` was renamend to
   `source` because it is also useful for PEAR extensions.
   `pecl_source` can still be used but is deprecated and will be
   removed in the next major release.
 * Parameters referring to time in `php::fpm::config` can now be
   specified with units (i.e. `'60s'`, `'1d'`):
   * `emergency_restart_threshold`
   * `emergency_restart_interval`
   * `process_control_timeout`
 * The PEAR version is not independant of `$php::ensure` and can be
   configured with `$php::pear_ensure`
 * Give special thanks to the contributors of this release:
   * Petr Sedlacek
   * Sherlan Moriah

## 3.0.1
 * Fix typo in package suffix for php-fpm on RHEL in params.pp

## 3.0.0
 * Removes `$php::fpm::pool::error_log`. Use the `php_admin_flag` and
   `php_admin_value` parameters to set the php settings `log_errors` and
   `error_log` instead.
 * Removes support for PHP 5.3 on Debian-based systems. See the notes in the
   README for more information.
 * Removes the `php_version` fact which had only worked on the later puppet runs.
 * Moves CLI-package handling to `php::packages`
 * Allows changing the package prefix via `php::package_prefix`.
 * Moves FPM-package handling from `php::fpm::package` to `php::fpm`
 * Changes `php::packages`, so that `php::packages::packages` becomes
   `php::packages::names` and are installed and `php::packages::names_to_prefix`
   are installed prefixed by `php::package_prefix`.
 * PHPUnit is now installed as phar in the same way composer is installed,
   causing all parameters to change
 * The `php::extension` resource has a new parameter: `zend`. If set to true,
   exenstions that were installed with pecl are loaded with `zend_extension`.

 * Style fixes all over the place
 * Module dependencies are now bound to the current major version

   * The parameter `config` of `php::extension` resources is now called `settings`
   * The parameters `user` and `group` of `php::fpm` have been moved to `php::fpm::config`
